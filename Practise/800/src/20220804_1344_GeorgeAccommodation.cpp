Question: George has recently entered the BSUCP (Berland State University for Cool Programmers). 
George has a friend Alex who has also entered the university. Now they are moving into a dormitory.

George and Alex want to live in the same room. The dormitory has n rooms in total. At the moment 
the i-th room has pi people living in it and the room can accommodate qi people in total (pi ≤ qi). 
Your task is to count how many rooms has free place for both George and Alex.

Input
The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of rooms.

The i-th of the next n lines contains two integers pi and qi (0 ≤ pi ≤ qi ≤ 100) — the
 number of people who already live in the i-th room and the room's capacity.

Output
Print a single integer — the number of rooms where George and Alex can move in.
